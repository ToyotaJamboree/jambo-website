Barnwell Mountain Recreation Area (BMRA), TMTCs 1st Property, was officially opened in July 2000 and has become one of the premiere off-highway parks in the United States. BMRA is one of the largest projects principally using the Recreational Trails Program Grant Process.

Some of BMRAs amenities include Full Shower and Bathroom facilities, port-a-potties throughout the property, a well marked trail system utilizing unobtrusive trail signage. These signs are now being used at many off-road facilities including the Superlift ORV Park in Hot Springs, AR.

This beautiful 1800 acre park located 5 miles north of Gilmer TX on highway 155 is a shining example of what TMTC and its members and volunteers can accomplish. TMTC and BMRA have been recognized by such organizations as Texas Parks & Wildlife, The Blue Ribbon Coalition, Tread Lightly!, National Off Highway Vehicle Conservation Council, The ATV Safety Institute (ASI), American Motorcyclist Association, United Four Wheel Drive Association, Southwest Four Wheel Drive Association, as well as many regional and state organizations.
