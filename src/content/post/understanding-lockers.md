Off-roading is a challenging and exciting activity that requires a combination of vehicle and driver skills. Most of your mods for your rig and skills you will sharpen center two simple ideas: Your approach and line to overcome obstacles (without severaly tearing up your vehicle) and maintaining traction, and there is no shortage of debate and discussion on what mods and vehicles are best to increase your ability to perform those two task. A locking differential is certainly of no exception.  

As a 4x4 truck owner, you may have heard the term "locker" being thrown around by other off-road enthusiasts. But what exactly is a locker, and why is it so important for those who love to hit the rough terrain? 

In this blog post, we'll explore the different types of 4x4 differential lockers and their benefits, compare them to other off-road driving assist systems, and give you an overview of the different options available on Toyota 4x4 trucks.

## The Challenge
To understand how lockers and other driving assist systems help, you need to understand some fundamentals of the problem.  Your 4x4 differential is a component of a four-wheel drive vehicle that splits the engine's torque between the front and rear wheels. In normal driving conditions, the differential allows the front and rear wheels to rotate at different speeds, allowing the vehicle to turn smoothly.

While this is great for on pavement driving, when off-roading, this system can become a problem because it can cause a loss of traction on one or more of the wheels. This can occur when one wheel encounters a slippery or uneven surface, or due to articulation has left the ground, causing it to spin faster than the other wheel as more and more power is transferred to it. Eventually you may get to the point where the free wheel is free spinning leaving the wheel with traction no remaining torque to push you through the obstacle. 

Differential lockers are intended to overcome this problem. 

## What is a 4x4 Differential Locker?

A locker is a device that is installed in the differential of a 4x4 truck, allowing the driver to lock the differential, which in turn causes both wheels on an axle to rotate at the same speed. 

So when one wheel loses traction, the locked differential will ensure that power is still delivered to the other wheel, maintaining maximum traction and stability.

## Different Types of 4x4 Differential Lockers

As you probaly have already guessed, locked differentials pose a problem for on-road use. With that differential locked turning is reduced, tires will squeal, wearing unevenly, and greater strain is placed on your drivetrain and equipment.  While you could permenently lock your differential, this would be more headache that fun unless you are building a off-road only rig or buggy. 

Therefore the differences in lockers focues around how they engage and disengage, each with its own strengths and weaknesses:

#### Mechanical Locker:
Mechanical lockers, also known as "lunchbox" lockers, are always active and locking is induced when in on-throttle conditions, when load is applied to the differential.  When diff is unloaded, the unit is partially unlocked. When the vehicle is turning, the unit makes a loud clicking sound. 

Mechanical lockers, being generally more simple, reliable and durable, require less maintence than selectable lockers. They also tend to be more affordable, making them a popular choice for off-road enthusiasts. 

However, mechanical lockers can be noisy, making a "clunking" sound when they are engaged, disengaged or turning, which may make them unsuited for vehicles that spend alot of time on the streed. 

#### Electronic Locker:
An electronic locker uses an electronic control system to lock and unlock the differential gears. It is quieter and smoother than a mechanical locker, but it can be more complex and expensive.

E-lockers are fairly popular among Toyota off-roaders as its a factory option in various models in 4Runners and Tacomas and is known to be very reliable, requiring minimal maintentance compared to other types of lockers. 

One flaw to the design is it tends to stick in the locked position after it has been turned off as long as torque is sill applied. Changing from forward to reverse can sometimes feel sloppy or clunky at times as well. Also, compared to air-lockers which lock almost immediantly, when flipped on, a degree of rotation will need to occur in in order for locking mechanisms to engage and a level of care needs to be taken when engaging as they can be damaged if improperly used. 

A huge benefit to e-lockers is they only need a 12v power connection and not an air compressor like air lockers.

#### Air-Actuated Locker:
An air-actuated locker uses compressed air to engage and disengage the locking mechanism. It is similar to an electronic locker in terms of noise and smoothness, but it is simpler and more reliable.

When air, provided form an on-board compressor or CO2 tank, provides pneumatic pressure, a locking collar slides forward locking the gears and therefore wheels together. 

A huge benefit of air lockers is, being they rely on pneumatic pressure, they engage almost immediately and can be switched on at any vehicle speed. 

Around since the late 1970's ARB Air Lockers is an extremely popular brand of air-lockers and are the go-to for most off-roaders. 

This design does have its share of issues, as its locking system is overly complicated, there are many thigns that can fail easy or go wrong ranging from leaking air lines, damaged o-rings to failed electrical connections to even a blown fuse.   However, when it is working, and installed correctly, it works really well. 


#### Limited Slip Differential (LSD): 
A limited slip differential (LSD) also known as Posi or Trac-Lock differentials uses clutches and springs to increase friction of the differential gears to prevent them from turning at different speeds.  When one wheel looses traction, power will still be delivered through the clutches to the other wheel until the threshold of the friction plates is reached and the spin free. There are different selections of frictions plates, that allow a variety of aggressiveness of power transfer. 

LSD's are always on, as such everytime you vehicles turns and wheels are forced to spin a different speeds, the clutches are rubbing against each other, causing wear and will eventually wear out. There are 

 LSDs provide some level of differentiation between the wheels, allowing for a more comfortable and stable ride on the road.


 #### What about Toyota's VSC

VSC is actually not a differential locking mechanism at all

Toyota Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) is a safety and stability control system that helps drivers maintain control of their vehicle in challenging driving conditions. VSC works by using sensors to monitor the vehicle's speed, steering angle, and lateral acceleration, and then using this information to help the driver maintain control of the vehicle.

VSC operates by applying individual brakes to one or more wheels, and reducing engine power when necessary. This helps the driver maintain control of the vehicle, even if the wheels start to slip or the vehicle begins to skid. VSC is especially useful in wet, slippery, or uneven conditions, and can help drivers avoid accidents and maintain control of their vehicle when driving off-road.

### Lockers vs. Crawl Control: What's the Difference?

A differential locker provides equal power to both wheels, allowing both wheels to rotate at the same speed and maintain traction on rough terrain. Crawl Control, on the other hand, is an advanced off-road driving assist system that automatically controls the throttle and brakes to help the driver navigate rough terrain.

While lockers provide maximum traction, they do not provide any additional control or assistance to the driver. Crawl Control, on the other hand, is stated to take the stress out of navigating tough terrain by automatically controlling the vehicle's speed and brakes, allowing the driver to focus on steering.


 #### Toyota Crawl Control
Toyota Crawl Control is an advanced off-road driving assist system that is available on some Toyota 4x4 trucks. It helps the driver navigate rough terrain by automatically controlling the throttle and brakes, allowing the driver to focus on steering. 

Crawl Control operates in five low-speed settings, each designed to handle different types of terrain, such as mud, rocks, or gravel. It uses sensors to monitor the vehicle's speed, angle, and traction, and it adjusts the speed and brakes accordingly, helping to maintain traction and stability. 

Crawl Control also works with the vehicle's stability control system to ensure that the truck stays on track, even on challenging terrain. In short, Toyota Crawl Control helps to take the stress out of off-roading by providing maximum traction and stability on rough terrain

#### Other Options for Navigating Tough Terrain in Toyota 4x4 Trucks

In addition to lockers and Crawl Control, there are several other options available on Toyota 4x4 trucks that can help you navigate tough terrain. Some of these options include:

**Multi-Terrain Select:** Multi-Terrain Select is a system that allows you to choose from five different terrain modes, each optimized for a specific type of terrain, such as mud, sand, or rocks.

**Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS):** The KDSS system is designed to help improve the vehicle's handling on rough terrain by automatically adjusting the stiffness of the suspension.

**Active Traction Control (A-TRAC)**: A-TRAC is a system that uses the vehicle's ABS system to distribute power to the wheels with the most traction, helping to maintain stability and control on rough terrain.
